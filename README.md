# Finite-Element-Method-Project
The program capable of calculating the non-stationary solution of heat transfer problem using Finite Element Method.

## NOTICES
- The project has been translated to english, so the polish PDF including code screenshots might differ.
- The project already includes 4 grid files: Test1_4_4.txt, Test2_4_4_MixGrid.txt, Test3_31_31_square.txt and Test4_31_31_trapezium.txt. Any other grid files should work as well but shall be placed in proper directory.
